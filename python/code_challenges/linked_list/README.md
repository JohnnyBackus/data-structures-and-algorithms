# Linked-List

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- Create a Linked List class
- Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
  - Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
- The class should contain the following methods
  - insert
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: nothing
    - Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  - includes
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: Boolean
      - Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
  - to string
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
    - `{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL`
