# Stack and Queue

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Node

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

## Stack

- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
  - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
  - The class should contain the following methods:
  - push
    - Arguments: value
    - adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
  - pop
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
    - Removes the node from the top of the stack
    - Should raise exception when called on empty stack
  - peek
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
    - Should raise exception when called on empty stack
  - is empty
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

## Queue

- Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
  - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
  - The class should contain the following methods:
  - enqueue
    - Arguments: value
    - adds az new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
  - dequeue
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
    - Removes the node from the front of the queue
    - Should raise exception when called on empty queue
  - peek
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
    - Should raise exception when called on empty stack
  - is empty
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty

## Solution

```class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, head=None):
        self.head = head

    def insert(self, value):
        node = Node(value)
        node.next = self.head
        self.head = node

    def includes(self, value):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            if current.value == value:
                return True
            current = current.next
        return False

    def __str__(self):
        output = ''
        current = self.head
        while current:
            output += f'{{ {current.value} }} -> '
            current = current.next
        output += 'NULL'
        return output

    return pass```
